# Shared Standards Repository

## 1. Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains the shared development standards, documentation, scripts, and configurations that are used by both the Gemini and Claude agents at BjzyLabs. It is one of the three core standards repositories, alongside `gemini-standards` and `claude-standards`.

These standards are intended to be used as a Git submodule in all projects, providing a consistent and version-controlled set of shared resources.

## 2. Structure

This repository contains a collection of shared resources, including:

*   **`docs/`**: Shared documentation, including coding standards, Git workflow, and other guidelines.
*   **`configs/`**: Shared configuration files for various tools.
*   ... (and other shared resources)

## 3. Relationship to Other Standards

*   **`gemini-standards`**: Contains the standards for the Gemini agent.
*   **`claude-standards`**: Contains the standards for the Claude agent.

All three repositories are designed to be used together as submodules within a project, typically managed via the `template-repository`.
